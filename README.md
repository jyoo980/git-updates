## Scratch work/Ideas
* 1 scene with the users you follow on GitHub
    * Tapping a user cell will take you to the Single User Scene
* Single User Scene will just have the user's most recent activity
    * Maybe use Charts for iOS to graph the frequency of commits?

## Development dependencies
* <strong>Cocoapods</strong>: install Cocoapods globally, `sudo gem install cocoapods`
* <strong>Alamofire/AlamofireImage</strong>: navigate to project directory, run `pod init`, open `Podfile` in the text editor of your choice, include the line: `pod 'AlamofireImage', '~> 3.3'` under the line `target`.
